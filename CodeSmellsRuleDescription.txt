Code Smells Rule ~ Interfaces Should Not Inherit Different Base Interfaces with Similar Members

When you inherit from two interfaces but both of the interfaces have the same member name, 
the member through the derived interface will result in a complied error, CS0229. To avoid this 
error, you need to rename the member name to remove the collision and defining that member 
in the derived interface.
